	abstract = "{The compact mm-wavelength signal in the central cavity of the PDS 70 disc, revealed by deep ALMA observations, is aligned with unresolved H α emission, and is thought to stem from a circumplanetary disc (CPD) around PDS 70c. We revisit the available ALMA data on PDS 70c with alternative imaging strategies, and with special attention to uncertainties and to the impact of the so-called ‘JvM correction’, which is thought to improve the dynamic range of restored images. We also propose a procedure for the alignment and joint imaging of multi-epoch visibility data. We find that the JvM correction exaggerates the peak signal-to-noise of the data, by up to a factor of 10. In the case of PDS 70, we recover the detection of PDS 70c from the 2019 July data, but only at 8 σ. However, its non-detection in 2017 Dec. suggests that PDS 70c is variable by at least \\$42\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\} \\pm 13\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ over a 1.75 yr time-span, so similar to models of the H α variability. We also pick up fine structure in the inner disc, such that its peak is offset by ∼0\\$\\{\_\\{.\\}^\\{\\prime\\prime\\}\\}\\$04 from the disc centre. The inner disc is variable too, which we tentatively ascribe to Keplerian rotation as well as intrinsic morphological changes.}",

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
	abstract = {The interpretation of molecular-line data using hydrodynamical simulations of planet–disk interactions fosters new hope for the indirect detection of protoplanets. In a model-independent approach, embedded protoplanets should be found at the roots of abrupt Doppler flips in velocity centroid maps. However, the largest velocity perturbation known for an unwarped disk, in the disk of HD 100546, leads to a conspicuous Doppler flip that coincides with a thick dust ring, in contradiction with an interpretation in terms of a ≳1 M jup body. Here we present new ALMA observations of the 12CO(2–1) kinematics in HD 100546, with a factor of 2 finer angular resolutions. We find that the disk rotation curve is consistent with a central mass 2.1 &lt; M ⋆/M ⊙ &lt; 2.3 and that the blueshifted side of the Doppler flip is due to vertical motions, reminiscent of the disk wind proposed previously from blueshifted SO lines. We tentatively propose a qualitative interpretation in terms of a surface disturbance to the Keplerian flow, i.e., a disk eruption, driven by an embedded outflow launched by a ∼10 M earth body. Another interpretation involves a disk-mass-loading hot spot at the convergence of an envelope accretion streamer.}

	title = {Dust Unveils the Formation of a Mini-Neptune Planet in a Protoplanetary Ring},
	journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
	abstract = {Rings and radial gaps are ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks, yet their possible connection to planet formation is currently subject to intense debates. In principle, giant planet formation leads to wide gaps that separate the gas and dust mass reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass planets lead to shallow gaps that are manifested mainly on the dust component. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the star HD 169142, host to a prominent disk with deep, wide gaps that sever the disk into inner and outer regions. The new ALMA high-resolution images allow for the outer ring to be resolved as three narrow rings. The HD 169142 disk thus hosts both the wide gap trait of transition disks and a narrow-ring system similar to those observed in the TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond a deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed rings are narrow in radial extent (width/radius of 1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2, and 3.4/76.0 in au) and have asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle ring are separated by 7 au while the middle and outermost ring are distanced by ∼12 au. Using hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple explanation, involving a single migrating low-mass planet (10 M⊕), entirely accounts for such an apparently complex phenomenon. Inward migration of the planet naturally explains the ring’s asymmetric mutual separation. The isolation of HD 169142's outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to interpret the detailed architecture of the outer region of protoplanetary disks with low-mass planet formation of mini-Neptune’s size, i.e., as in the protosolar nebula.}
